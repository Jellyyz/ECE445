This is the initial call with HP. Contacts include my former coworkers and superiors @ HP who are on the Digital ASIC team. They go over the ideas that they have and confirm on the portable printer idea as the best idea. They give us ideas on how to build this project as I explain how the class functions and works. 
Kevin joins in on the call. Jason is unable to make it.

This is the initial meeting with the entire team. We have recieved a potential pitch from HP who has decided to give us some workload relating to a portable printer. We start very high level planning the idea and are looking for other ideas that are also feasible for our project.

Other ideas that were planned but failed to pass the idea stage:

1. Classroom detector 
2. Fish tank monitor

I meet with a TA who discusses the feasibility of this project and the requirements meeting. We as a group submit our original RFA by the end of the day, but misses some requirements that Viktor Gruev has mentioned. We add USB functionality to our hardware requirements which increases hardware complexity and this passes the early RFA deadline by tmmr.

I start work on the brainstorming of how the entire system works. The block diagram 1st draft is finished and HDL code is being brainstormed as well.
