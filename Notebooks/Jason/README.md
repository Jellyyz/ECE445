# Lab Notebook

## Jan. 24 - 25, 2023
By working on the RFA, we did a lot of brainstorming and searching for specific parts to consider.
LCDs and displays on Adafruit seemed quite promising because of their compactness, low price, and available library
for programming the display in C/C++. There were other displays that had more constrained dimensions like 
the Hitachi HD44780 LCD that Gally brought up. 

## Feb. 7, 2023 (20 minute TA meeting)
We met up for the first weekly TA meeting with Hanyin. We will be meeting weekly on Tuesdays at 4:20 PM to 4:40 PM.
We are preparing to get our important components (FPGA, MCU) so we can start basic testing.

The proposal is being worked on - we have a good general idea of the system and what each block should do. We received
a DE2 FPGA board in our locker.
