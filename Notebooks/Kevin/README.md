## Jan 18, 2023
Initial call with HP employees (Gally's coworkers) who are sponsors for the concept of the project. The project is proposed as an efficient and portable thermal printer, as well as ideas on algorithms we can implement through application specific digital hardware to assist in the printing process (or in our case, an FPGA since we don't have a large production volume requirement anyways).

## Jan 23, 2023
Meeting with groupmates Gally and Jason. GitHub repo is established, and begin planning/brainstorming high level ideas that we could turn to in addition to just the printer idea. Also discussed potential components we could use (microcontroller with built in WiFi chip, display, printer "guts", etc.). I proposed a classroom availability system on the Web Board earlier but a TA suggested that it was already a common idea, which steered us more towards the printer concept and we began to develop the RFA for it. Expectation is for us to have the RFA completed with the extra credit.

## Jan 25-26, 2023
Posted initial RFA for the portable printer on Web Board, received feedback from staff and improved certain aspects of design (complexity of PCB features, microcontroller integration, etc.). We reproposed the RFA, and got approval to move forward with the project. 

## Feb 3, 2023
Learned the basics of Django framework for application development through reading documentation and watching tutorials. Was able to create a basic local server that clients can connect to and make basic HTTP requests to, but definitely not a finished product by any means. Will need to get into this further for the WiFi subsystem as a whole, such as designing a frontend page, what a response will actually deliver to the MCU, etc.

## Feb 6, 2023
Wrote up the WiFi subsystem overview and requirements in preparation for the initial TA meeting and committed changes to the project proposal. 

## Feb 7, 2023
Met with TA Hanyin Shao, had our proposal (diagram, goals, etc.) reviewed for modification before the deadline. Arranged a weekly meeting time (4:20 pm every Tuesday), and went over general project deliverable requirements.

## Feb 9, 2023
Met with group to finish the proposal, including completing all the subsystems, revising the diagram, etc.

## Feb 11, 2023
Discussed components that need to be ordered when the my.ece order processing site is working again for the ECE 445 orders. The components have already been decided on, and we will have them ordered as soon as the issue with the site is fixed.

## Feb 14, 2023
Placed order for parts as listed on my.ece with new CFOP number:
- A 5 pack of SMT ESP8266 MCUs
- A 5 pack of ESP8266 development baords for prototyping/testing
- A 3 pack of USB to Micro-B cables

Order was approved on same day and will be shipped to the ECEB via Amazon so we may begin testing the microcontrollers before the end of this week. 

In addition, the group met with our TA to discuss areas for improvement on the proposal, which will also be necessary moving forward when creating the design document.
